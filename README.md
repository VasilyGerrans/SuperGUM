**SuperGUM** is a decentralised subscription-based content sharing platform.

* Using **SuperGUM** is as easy having a MetaMask wallet and connecting to a running instance of the app.
* **SuperGUM** uses [the Super DAI token](https://app.superfluid.finance/dashboard) as a medium of exchange.
* Your wallet is your page, and all wallet pages can be accessed by simply typing an Ethereum wallet address after the URL. 
* Your minimum subscription is the minimal monthly amount a follower must commit to in order to gain access to your content. 

**SuperGUM** is built with [Superfluid](https://www.superfluid.finance/home), allowing fans to spend an amount exactly proportional to the time spent accessing the content.

**SuperGUM** uses decentralised frontend hosting provided by [Skynet](https://siasky.net/) which ensures protection against bans from hosting providers and allows you to participate in keeping the platform online. Anybody can save their own copy of the **SuperGUM** frontend on Skynet and ensure access the to app <em>forever</em>.

You might be thinking to yourself: “How can one human being have possibly built all of that in just one month?” The answer is [Moralis](https://moralis.io/) – the ultimate web3 development platform – which services all page content and supplies the methods for storing files on [IPFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System).

# For devs

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm install`

Installs all dependencies.

`npm start`

Immediately starts the app and runs it in development mode.

`npm run build`

Builds the app. The built version can then be run in development mode or served in production mode.

The app was built using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started/).
